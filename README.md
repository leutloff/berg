# Berg CMS

Berg Content Management System is a web based CMS for publishing a regular
printed news letter, e.g. a bimonthly parish newsletter. It is suitable
for small editorial committees.

The focus of the system is the next issue to publish. An issue consists
of several articles. These articles are preprocessed and then composed
by LaTeX. The outcome is a PDF file that can be downloaded and then
sent directly to the print shop.

## Installing from ZIP Archives

There are three supported systems:

- Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty, 64-bit:
  [https://github.com/leutloff/bergcms/releases/latest/](https://github.com/leutloff/bergcms/releases/latest/)
- Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty, 32-bit:
  [https://github.com/leutloff/bergcms-build-ubuntu-i686/releases/latest/](https://github.com/leutloff/bergcms-build-ubuntu-i686/releases/latest/)
- Debian Jessie, 64-bit:
  [https://github.com/leutloff/bergcms-build-debian/releases/latest/](https://github.com/leutloff/bergcms-build-debian/releases/latest/)

Just unpack the ZIP-Archives, set up where to upload in a file named remoteconfig.cfg
and the use one of the deployment scripts, e.g. deploy.sh using FTP commands and
deploy_ssh.sh using SSH based commands.

## Building from Source

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leutloff/bergcms.png)](https://travis-ci.org/leutloff/bergcms) [![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/leutloff/bergcms.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

The most up-to-date documentation will be the Continuous Integration build
on Travis CI. The file .travis.yml performs the build of the C++ based
modules, runs C++ and Perl based unit tests, installs everything on a
local Apache web server and will perform some GUI tests.

Summary to prepare the development system - Example is executed with Ubuntu 16.04:

```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc g++ clang gdb python perl libtool autoconf automake make \
    patch curl ca-certificates file less git bzip2 xz-utils libc6-dev \
    zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev liblzma-dev libssl-dev libicu-dev wget
sudo apt-get install firefox-locale-de firefox chromium-browser kate okular
sudo apt-get install libboost1.58-all-dev cmake
sudo npm install mocha-cli typescript typings -g

git clone git@github.com:leutloff/bergcms.git
cd bergcms/
npm install
```

Summary to prepare the production system - command is executed on Ubuntu 16.04:

    sudo apt-get install apache2 apache2-suexec-custom texlive-base texlive-binaries texlive-extra-utils texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-lang-german texlive-latex-recommended texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-extra

Configure the system to point with [http://bergcms.local](http://bergcms.local) to a running webserver.
Add bergcms.local to /etc/hosts, e.g. change the line from
`127.0.0.1 localhost`
to
`127.0.0.1 localhost bergcms.local`.
An outline of the Apache configuration is shown in doc/etc_apache2.
The configuration used for Travis is stored in the build directory.
Enable the required apache modules: `sudo a2enmod suexec cgid rewrite`

These are the steps to perform a build itself:

- Clone or download the repository.
- Execute the script update_and_build_submodules.sh to initialize, update and
  build the submodules.
- Install the [Boost C++ library](http://boost.org). Download the Boost C++ Library from
  [http://www.boost.org/users/download/](http://www.boost.org/users/download/)
  (start with version 1.58, when unsure). Then extract and build boost library.
  Execute the following commands in the extracted source:
      ./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=atomic,chrono,date_time,exception,filesystem,iostreams,log,program_options,regex,signals,system,test,thread
      sudo ./b2 -j 4 link=shared runtime-link=shared install -d0 --prefix=/usr/local
- To test the build environment:
  Launch CMake GUI and point the source code the src directory and
  build the project. Alternatively the build can done using these commands:
      rm -rf build-local
      mkdir build-local && pushd build-local && cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../src
      make
      popd
- Run the script make_zip.sh. This will build all applications and put all
  the required files in a single ZIP file.
- Install the content of the ZIP file on the Web Server. Use the script
  install_locally.sh to perform this step together with some tweaks with
  regard the file permissions. The used install path can be adapted to
  local differences by overriding shell variables in a file named
  install_locally.cfg.

## Building with Visual Studio 2015

### Build Boost C++ Library

Build Boost from source [http://www.boost.org/users/download/](http://www.boost.org/users/download/). Just follow the
["Getting Started"](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_60_0/more/getting_started/windows.html)
and follow section 5.1 "Simplified Build From Source". Execute the following
commands in the unpacked source directory:
    bootstrap.bat
    .\b2 --with-atomic --with-chrono --with-date_time  --with-exception --with-filesystem --with-iostreams --with-log --with-program_options --with-regex --with-signals --with-system --with-test --with-thread link=shared

When using the prebuilt binaries from
[https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/) 
it is required
to add a symbolic link.
Create a symbolic link from lib to lib32-msvc-14.0 in the unpacked
directory. Start a command window as Administrator, go to directory and
enter `MKLINK /D lib lib32-msvc-14.0`.

### Install CMake

Install CMake 3.5.0 or newer and launch the CMake GUI. Enter the Berg
CMS source directory `bergcms\src`. Add an entry `BOOST_ROOT`
pointing to the above installed directory. Click on Configure and
Generate.

### Build and execute the unit tests

Open the generated Solution with Visual Studio and build it.
The unit tests (bergunittests) are running successfully
on Windows, too.

Adaptation to a windows web server would be the next step to make it run on
Windows. Feel free to send pull requests...

## Installation/Deployment

The installation means copying the content of the archive to the web server
executing the web applications. This can be accomplished in different ways depending
on the requirements of the web server. The archive is build during the build
process as described above.

Part of the archive content is a deployment script. The script deploy.sh copies
the surrounding files to a web server using ncftpput. So the version deployed
to web server depends on the path where the deploy.sh script is executed.

The servers are configured in a file named remotehosts.cfg. The supported
parameters should be copied from the beginning of the deploy.sh script. Here are
some examples calling the deploy.sh script.

Showing the available options and components:
    ./deploy.sh -h

The script supports the deployment to two different servers. One is called test
and the other one is the production server. Deploying the static HTML files to
the test server can be done using this command:
    ./deploy.sh -t test -c html

Copying everything to the production server:
    ./deploy.sh -t prod -c all

## GUI Tests and Unit Tests

The test suite for the user interface is based on the Selenium IDE.
Get the Firefox plug-in Selenium IDE
from [http://seleniumhq.org/download/](http://seleniumhq.org/download/).
Installation is described at
[http://seleniumhq.org/docs/02_selenium_ide.html](http://seleniumhq.org/docs/02_selenium_ide.html).

The test suites and test cases are located in the folder testsuite.
Put the file www/cgi-bin/brg/testcase.pl only on testing instances.
The CGI script will copy a database according the selected test case.
This will destroy the existing database. The existence of the testcase.pl
file allows the test cases to modify the database content.

Additional to the GUI test the different parts of the system are tested with
different types of unit tests. You will find unit tests written in C++ and
Perl. New unit tests should be written in C++ when feasible.

The unit tests for the C++-Code are located in src/test. Execute the project
named test to execute the C++ test cases. These test cases are based on
boost unit test.

The Perl related unit tests are located in www/cgi-bin/brg/t. Use the script
www/cgi-bin/brg/t/run_tests.sh to execute all the Perl based tests.
